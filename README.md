# techdegree_project2
Unit 2 project for TalentPath

A teacher from a nearby school has been having trouble teaching addition to her students. 
We’d like you to build an app which will quiz the students on basic addition. The app should start with a question 
(e.g. “What is 48 + 12?”) and list three answer choices below the question. If a student picks the correct answer, 
the app should toast “Correct!”. Otherwise, it should toast “Incorrect”. The app should then display the next question. 
Once all questions have been answered, the app should display a final score.
